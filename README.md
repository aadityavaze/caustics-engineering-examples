# Caustics Engineering

This repo is for generating 3D surface meshes that project caustic images. It is written in Julia.

See the write-up [here](https://mattferraro.dev/posts/caustics-engineering)!

# To Run

To run the cat example from the blogpost, run line by line from ` src/scratchpad.jl`.

_OR_ from the command line.

```
julia ./run.jl"
```
The image file is currently hard-coded.
